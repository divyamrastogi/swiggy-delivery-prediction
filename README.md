# Swiggy Hot Zones

## A demand prediction visualization built for the Swiggy Techstein Hackathon 2018.

### Inspiration
We wanted to optimize the way Swiggy's Delivery Executives moved around, by predicting demand and visualizing it on a map so that the supply could match the demand.
### Methodology
The data was generated using Random Forest regression and we made a Progressive Web App using Vue.js to visualize the data. For maps, we used Mapbox and Leaflet to paint polygons over the Map.
